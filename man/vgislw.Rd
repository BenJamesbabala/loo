\title{VGIS: Very good importance sampling}
\usage{
vgislw(lw, wcp = 20, wtrunc = 3/4, fix_value = 100,
  cores = parallel::detectCores())
}
\arguments{
\item{lw}{a matrix of log weights, For for computing LOO \code{lw = -log_lik}
(see \code{\link{extract_log_lik}}) and is an \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix
where \eqn{S} is the number of simulations and \eqn{N} is the number of
data points.}

\item{wcp}{the percentage of importance weights to use for the generalized
Pareto fit. The \code{wcp}\% largest weights are used as the sample from
which to estimate the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution.}

\item{wtrunc}{for truncating very large weights to \eqn{S}^\code{wtrunc}. Set
to zero for no truncation.}

\item{fix_value}{if the largest weight in any column of \code{lw} is greater
than the second largest by at least \code{fix_value}, the second largest
will be set equal to the largest. Set to zero to skip this step.}

\item{cores}{the number of cores to use for parallelization.}
}
\value{
A named with list with components \code{lw} (modified log weights)
and \code{k} (tail indices for the Pareto \eqn{k} estimates).

\note{
This function is primarily intended for internal use, but is exported
  so that users can call it directly for other purposes. Users simply
  wishing to compute LOO and WAIC should use the \code{\link{loo_and_waic}}
  function.
