\title{VGIS: Very good importance sampling}
\usage{
vgislw(lw, wcp = 20, wtrunc = 3/4, fix_value = 100,
  cores = parallel::detectCores())
}
\arguments{
\item{lw}{an \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix of log weights (\code{-log_lik} for
computing LOO. See \code{\link{extract_log_lik}}).}

\item{wcp}{the percentage of samples used for the generalized Pareto fit
estimate.}

\item{wtrunc}{for truncating very large weights to \eqn{S}^\code{wtrunc}. Set
to zero for no truncation.}

\item{fix_value}{if the largest value in any column of \code{lw} is greater
than the second largest by at least \code{fix_value}, then the second
largest value will be set equal to the largest. Set to zero to skip this
step.}

\item{cores}{the number of cores to use for parallelization.}
}
\value{
A named with list with components \code{lw} (modified log weights)
and \code{k} (tail indices for the Pareto \eqn{k} estimates).
}
\description{
VGIS: Very good importance sampling
}
\note{
This function is primarily intended for internal use, but is exported
  so that users can call it directly for other purposes. Users simply
  wishing to compute LOO and WAIC should use the \code{\link{loo_and_waic}}
  function.
