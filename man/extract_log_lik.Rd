\title{Convenience function for extracting the pointwise log-likelihood from a
fitted Stan model}
\usage{
extract_log_lik(stanfit, parameter_name = "log_lik")
}
\arguments{
\item{stanfit}{a \code{stanfit} (\pkg{rstan}) object.}

\item{parameter_name}{a character string naming the parameter (generated
quantity) in the Stan model corresponding to the log-likelihood.}
}
\value{
a matrix of (post-warmup) extracted draws.
}
\description{
Convenience function for extracting the pointwise log-likelihood from a
fitted Stan model
}
\details{
Stan does not automatically compute and store the pointwise
  log-likelihood, and so it is up to the user to incorporate it into the Stan
  program if it is to be extracted after fitting the model. In the Stan
  program the pointwise log likelihood can either be defined as a vector in
  the transformed parameters block (and then summed up in the model block) or
  it can be coded entirely in the generated quantities block. All else equal,
  we recommend using the generated quantities block so that the computations
  are carried out only once per saved iteration rather than once per HMC
  leapfrog step.

  After running Stan, the output will contain an \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix
  of pointwise log-likelihood values, where \eqn{S} is the size of the
  posterior sample (the number of saved draws) and \eqn{N} is the number of
  data points.

\note{
The \pkg{rstan} package is required in order to use this function
