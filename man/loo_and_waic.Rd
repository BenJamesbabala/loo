\title{LOO and WAIC}
\usage{
loo_and_waic(log_lik, cores = parallel::detectCores())
}
\arguments{
\item{log_lik}{an \eqn{s} by \eqn{n} matrix, where \eqn{s} is the size of the
posterior sample (the number of simulations) and \eqn{n} is the
number of data points. Typically (but not restricted to be) the object
returned by \code{\link{extract_log_lik}}.}

\item{cores}{number of cores to use for parallization.}
}
\value{
a named list. Returned for both loo and waic are the expected log
  pointwise predictive density (elpd), the estimated effective number of
  parameters, the information criteria on the deviance scale, and estimated
  standard errors for each of these measures. Also returned are a matrix of
  the pointwise contributions of each of the measures and a vector containing
  the estimated shape parameter \eqn{k} for the Pareto fit to the importance
  ratios for each leave-one-out distribution.
