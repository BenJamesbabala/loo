\description{
LOO and WAIC
}
\details{
Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable
information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample
prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood
evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC
have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as
AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional
computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and
WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We compute LOO
using very good importance sampling (VGIS), a new procedure for regularizing
importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain
approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing
of pre- dictive errors between two models.
