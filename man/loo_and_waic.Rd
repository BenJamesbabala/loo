\usage{
loo_and_waic(log_lik, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_lik}{an \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix, where \eqn{S} is the size of the
posterior sample (the number of simulations) and \eqn{N} is the number of
data points. Typically (but not restricted to be) the object returned by
\code{\link{extract_log_lik}}.}

\item{...}{optional arguments to pass to \code{\link{vgislw}}. Possible
arguments and their defaults are:
\describe{
\item{\code{wcp = 20}}{the percentage of samples used for the generalized
Pareto fit estimate}
\item{\code{wtrunc = 3/4}}{for truncating very large weights to
\eqn{N}^\code{wtrunc} (set to zero for no truncation)}
\item{\code{cores = \link[parallel]{detectCores}()}}{the number of cores to
     use for parallelization.}
}}
}
\value{
a named list. Returned for both LOO and WAIC are the expected log
  pointwise predictive density (\code{elpd} ), the estimated effective number
  of parameters (\code{p}), and the information criteria on the deviance scale
  (e.g. \code{looic = -2*elpd_loo}). Also returned are the pointwise
  contributions of each of these measures, standard errors, and the estimated
  shape parameter \eqn{k} for the Pareto fit to the importance ratios for
  each leave-one-out distribution.
