Description: We efficiently approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) using very good importance sampling (VGIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors, and for the comparison of predictive errors between two models. We also compute the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC).
