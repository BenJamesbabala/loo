Description: We compute leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) using very good importance sampling (VGIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models.
